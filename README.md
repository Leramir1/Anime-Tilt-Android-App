Anime-Tilt-Android-App
======================

Hello and welcome,

 When this device is tilted in a certain direction there will be a sound clip from an anime that is played for a timed duration.
 This project was created by Alfonso Aranzazu, Chape Ngau, Jun Kawa and Luis Ramirez. In this assignment we familiarze ourselves 
 with the Android app developement processes. We tested and built accordingly the functions that would make the device emit a 
 sound when placed in a specific tilt. We captured six different stances where each stance is tied with a specific anime soundtrack.
 
 You will be able to run the app with the apk file.
